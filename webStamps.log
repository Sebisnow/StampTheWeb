<h1>Aung San Suu Kyi's party takes seats in historic session of Myanmar parliament </h1><html><body><div><div class="content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body" itemprop="articleBody" data-test-id="article-review-body">
<p>After half a century of military-dominated rule, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> has led her National League for Democracy (NLD) party into Myanmar’s parliament, taking a majority of seats and starting the process of installing a democratically elected government.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi has waited more than 25 years for this moment, having won a parliamentary majority in 1990 that was annulled by the military leadership. In November last year, she led the NLD to another landslide victory that has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/aung-san-suu-kyi-talks-army-chief-new-myanmar-parliament" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class="u-underline">accepted by the outgoing army-aligned government</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hundreds of NLD parliamentarians, many of them former political prisoners during successive military regimes, took their seats in the lower house on Monday morning. The party won 80% of all electable positions during a general election in November, with the military reserving a quarter of total seats.</p>
<p>The Nobel peace prize laureate, flowers in her hair, avoided hordes of reporters in the capital Nay Pyi Taw when she used a side entrance to enter the parliament. Her NLD lawmakers wore orange, overshadowing the military’s light green in the house.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi did not comment as she entered parliament.</p>
<p>U Min Oo, an NLD MP from Bago constituency, said the day felt very special. </p>
<p>“It’s the second time I have been elected but this time it feels different, because the NLD is majority. It’s an overwhelming majority, but we all come from different backgrounds and we can guarantee diversity.”</p>
<p>Win Myint, a close aide to Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD MP, was sworn in as house speaker. But T Khun Myat, member of the outgoing government USDP party, was also elected as deputy speaker in<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/aung-san-suu-kyi-building-peace-will-be-nld-partys-priority-in-government" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class="u-underline"> a sign of the political pragmatism </a>the NLD leader has adopted in recent years.</p>

<p>President Thein Sein, a former general who implemented gradual reforms since 2011, will stand down in March or April when an NLD president takes over.</p>
<p>While Aung San Suu Kyi is barred by an army-drafted constitution from taking the country’s most powerful position, her overwhelming majority in both houses of parliament allows her to handpick the president from her loyalist circles.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest, has said the NLD victory places her “above the president”. She will likely announce her candidate, who will act as a proxy, later this month.</p>
<p>The military and its allies in government have repeatedly and publicly stated they will abide the results.</p>

<p>However, the most powerful ministerial positions – home, defence and border affairs – will be reserved for Myanmar’s armed forces, or Tatmadaw, giving the generals continued power in the south-east Asian nation.</p>
<p>Despite that, Roland Kobia, the EU ambassador to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">Myanmar</a>, said the nation was on track to true democracy.</p>
<p>“Myanmar is step by step confirming its aspiration to a real democratic change and to a genuinely new political direction,” he said.</p>
<p>“A lot still needs to be done, but meaningful progress can happen through the commitment of the Myanmar people and political will of its leaders.”</p>
