<h1>Saudi King Shakes Up Government as Economic Plan Moves Forward - The New York Times</h1><html><body><div><div class="story-body">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="2746" id="story-continues-3">Many of the changes announced Saturday were aimed at restructuring the government so it would work toward the plan’s goals.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="359" data-total-count="3105">These included the replacement of the country’s long-serving oil minister, Mr. Naimi, who is 80 and had held the position since 1995. Mr. Naimi’s oversight of oil policy for the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter, had made him a towering figure whose mere utterances were closely scrutinized by traders seeking to divine the country’s thinking.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="3437">The decline in oil prices, which began in mid-2014, led Mr. Naimi to champion the Saudi strategy of maintaining production levels to preserve market share and undermine higher-cost producers like the United States. While the approach has largely worked, it has also contributed to an oil glut that has kept prices low, analysts say.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="3663">Mr. Naimi has long been essential to the royal family’s policy of using the country’s oil wealth to finance government social policy — a tradition Prince Mohammed wants to move away from through widespread privatization.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="3830">Although Mr. Naimi had long expressed a wish to retire, the suddenness of his exit struck some foreign analysts as a sign that Prince Mohammed was flexing his muscles.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="4209">“To essentially drop him in a cabinet reshuffle rather than celebrate his retirement was pretty rude, even by Saudi standards,” said David L. Goldwyn, who was a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. “The way he left is a sign of Mohammed bin Salman making clear that he is directing the appointment of important positions.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="4431" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Naimi was named an adviser to the royal court and was replaced by a younger official, Khalid al-Falih, who had previously run the Health Ministry and served as the chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="4744">Some energy experts viewed the appointment of Mr. Falih as a signal to both the Saudi power structure and international oil markets that Prince Mohammed was pushing forward with plans to transform Saudi Aramco into an energy conglomerate that could invest in projects with less interference from the royal family.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="4985">In the announcement on Saturday, the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources, a semantic shift meant to indicate the country’s commitment to diversifying away from oil.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="5217">Most energy experts said they did not see Mr. Naimi’s departure as a sign that oil policy would soon change, especially with prices gradually rising and Saudi leaders refusing to endorse production limits unless Iran does as well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="5542">“The Saudis sneeze and the oil market catches a cold, but I think it’s going to turn out not to mean much,” said Michael Lynch, the president of the consultancy Strategic Energy and Economic Research, who has been an adviser to OPEC. “By picking Khalid al-Falih, it doesn’t seem like this means a radical change.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="5738">Other decrees announced on Saturday changed the head of the central bank, renamed and combined ministries, and put new officials in charge of water, commerce, social affairs, health and transport.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="6046">“All these measures were ultimately aimed at making government more efficient and more accountable, reducing red tape,” said Fahad Nazer, a senior political analyst at JTG Inc., a consulting firm based in Vienna, Va. “They are clearly meant to help in terms of implementing the vision going forward.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="6277">None of the decrees addressed the country’s political structure, and missing from Prince Mohammed’s vision were any moves toward allowing Saudis a role in choosing their rulers. None of the newly appointed officials were women.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="6345" id="story-continues-5">Other changes were in line with goals articulated in the new vision.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="431" data-total-count="6776">The Ministry of Hajj, an important body in a country that derives much of its international standing from its management of Islam’s holiest sites, was changed to the Ministry of Hajj and Umra. While the Hajj pilgrimage happens once a year, the Umra pilgrimage can be done year round, and Prince Mohammed has spoken of raising the number of Umra visitors as a source of unexploited income. The body’s minister was also replaced.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="408" data-total-count="7184">Many among Saudi Arabia’s large population of young people — more than two-thirds of the country’s 20 million citizens are under 30 — speculated on social media, often with sarcasm, about the duties of the newly created General Authority for Entertainment, a surprising body in a hyperconservative country where public movie theaters are banned and many people flee abroad for vacations and weekends.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="7352">Some Twitter users responded by posting photos of members of the religious police <a href="https://twitter.com/orangejuicee123/status/729064169228673026">smashing musical instruments</a> under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%87?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=hash">#The_Entertainment_Authority</a> in Arabic.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="7443">“Oh Lord!” one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Moodeey3/status/728949262566961153">wrote</a>. “Theater, opera, cinema and stadiums for women.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="7598">Another <a href="https://twitter.com/amalkhalid17/status/729064076786192389">wrote</a>: “They split the electricity ministry and the water ministries for fear of electrocution. Joke courtesy of #The_Entertainment_Authority.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="7797">Prince Mohammed has spoken about the importance of providing Saudis with more ways to enjoy life in their country, although it remains to be seen what new options will be provided under the new plan.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
