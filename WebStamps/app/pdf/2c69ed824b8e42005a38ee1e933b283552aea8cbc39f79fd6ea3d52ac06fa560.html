<h1>Saudi King Shakes Up Government as Economic Plan Moves Forward - The New York Times</h1><html><body><div><div class="story-body">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="2331" id="story-continues-3">Among those changes was the replacement of the country’s long-serving oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, who is in his 80s and had held the position since 1995. Mr. Naimi’s oversight of oil policy for the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter, had made him a towering figure in world oil policy, whose mere utterances were closely scrutinized by traders seeking to understand the country’s thinking.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="2651">Since oil prices began declining in mid-2014, Mr. Naimi has championed the Saudi strategy of maintaining production levels to preserve market share and undermine higher-cost producers like the United States. While the strategy has largely worked, it has contributed to an oil glut that has kept prices low, analysts say.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="2873">Mr. Naimi was named an adviser to the royal court and was replaced by a younger official, Khalid al-Falih, who had previously run the Health Ministry and served as the chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="464" data-total-count="3337">Some energy experts viewed the emergence of Mr. Falih to replace Mr. Naimi as a highly symbolic move that sent a strong signal to both the Saudi power structure and international oil markets. It was another sign that Prince Mohammed was consolidating his position as the chief architect of economic policy and of the transformation of Saudi Aramco into an independent oil company with the ability to invest in projects with less interference from the royal family.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="3542">Mr. Naimi had long helped carry out the royal family’s policy of using the company to finance government social policy — a tradition Prince Mohammed wants to veer from through widespread privatization.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="3698">While Mr. Naimi had long expressed the desire to retire, the suddenness of his exit struck some analysts as a sign of Prince Mohammed’s displaying muscle.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="504" data-total-count="4202" id="story-continues-4">“It was an unceremonious departure for a man who devoted his entire life to the Saudi oil world and planned to resign anyway,” said David L. Goldwyn, who was a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. “To essentially drop him in a cabinet reshuffle rather than celebrate his retirement was pretty rude, even by Saudi standards. The way he left is a sign of Mohammed bin Salman making clear that he is directing the appointment of important positions.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="252" data-total-count="4454">In the announcement on Saturday, the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources, a semantic shift meant to indicate the country’s commitment to diversifying its income away from oil.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="4735">Most energy experts said they did not see Mr. Naimi’s departure as a sign that policy would soon change, especially with oil prices gradually rising. They said no changes in policy were likely to occur as long as Prince Mohammed and his father opposed an accommodation with Iran.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="5109">“The Saudis sneeze and the oil market catches a cold, but I think it’s going to turn out not to mean much,” said Michael Lynch, the president of the consultancy Strategic Energy and Economic Research, who has been an adviser to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “By picking Khalid al-Falih, it doesn’t seem like this means a radical change.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="5264">Other decrees announced on Saturday changed the head of the central bank and named new ministers for water, commerce, social affairs, health and transport.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="5566">“All these measures were ultimately aimed at making government more efficient and more accountable, reducing red tape,” said Fahad Nazer, a senior political analyst at JTG Inc., a consulting firm in Vienna, Va. “They are clearly meant to help in terms of implementing the vision going forward.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="5853">Other changes also jibed with goals articulated in the new vision, showing the tight coordination between Prince Mohammed, who has emerged as the country’s most dynamic official despite being second in line for the throne, and his father, King Salman, who maintains ultimate authority.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="6279">The Ministry of Hajj, an important body in a country that derives much of its international legitimacy from its management of Islam’s holiest sites, was changed to the Ministry of Hajj and Umra. While the Hajj pilgrimage happens once a year, the Umra pilgrimage can be done year-round, and Prince Mohammed has spoken of expanding the number of Umra visitors as a source of unexploited income. Its minister was also replaced.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="394" data-total-count="6673">Many people among Saudi Arabia’s large youth population — more than two-thirds of the country’s 20 million citizens are under 30 — speculated on social media about the duties of the newly created General Commission for Entertainment. It is a surprising body in a hyperconservative country where public movie theaters are banned and many people spend their vacations and weekends abroad.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="6853" id="story-continues-5">Prince Mohammed has spoken about the importance of providing Saudis with more ways to enjoy life in their country, although it remains to be seen what new options will be provided.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
