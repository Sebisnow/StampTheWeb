<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="299">We know that resentment is driving much of Donald Trump’s success — resentment of elites, of the political class, of illegal immigrants, of protesters, of the media — and perhaps most particularly of changes in the demographic makeup of the country that Trump and his followers find unwelcome.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="480">Part of the explanation for the triumph of resentment is political and economic, but one question has nagged at me. What is the psychological mechanism underpinning this resentment?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="878">Six months ago, I <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/campaign-stops/euro-trump.html">wrote</a> that Donald Trump’s “presidential campaign was following the path of right-wing working class parties in Europe.” In the United States since then, Democratic politicians and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/trump-obama-and-the-assault-on-political-correctness.html">media</a> have struggled to enter the minds of Trump voters, who are evidently enraged by the imposition of norms of political correctness that they see as enforced by “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-the-rising-hegemony-of-the-politically-correct.html?pagewanted=all">Stalinist orthodoxy</a>.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="1291">Trump has capitalized on the visceral belief of many white voters that government-enforced diversity and other related regulations are designed “<a href="http://humanevents.com/2010/10/31/its-not-political-correctness-but-brutal-liberal-mccarthyism/">to bring Americans to submission</a>” by silencing their opposition to immigration — legal and illegal — to judicial orders putting low-income housing in the suburbs, and to government-mandated school integration, to name just a few of their least favorite things.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="1506">Trump’s supporters, judging from the venom with which they refer to “political correctness,” perceive the <a href="http://www.prrac.org/pdf/AppendixB.pdf">network of state, local</a> and <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/index.cfm">federal anti-discrimination laws and directives</a> as censorious and coercive.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="1948" id="story-continues-1">The furor over political correctness has been brewing for a half century, since the broad <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/race/edsall.htm">rights revolution</a> of the 1960s, which included the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act on the heels of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The 1965 legislation and subsequent measures <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/us-immigration-since-1965">shifted United States policy</a> to raise the total number of immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America and to sharply reduce the proportion of European whites.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="2277">The result was unanticipated by the sponsors of the original act, according to the nonpartisan website <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/us-immigration-since-1965">History.com</a>, which reports that in the 1950s, more than 50 percent of immigrants were from Europe, and just 6 percent from Asia. By the 1990s, Europeans had fallen to 16 percent of the total and Asians had grown to 31 percent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="2295">More to the point:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="2604"><p>Between 1965 and 2000, the highest number of immigrants (4.3 million) to the U.S. came from <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/mexico">Mexico</a>, in addition to some 1.4 million from the Philippines. Korea, the Dominican Republic, India, Cuba and Vietnam were also leading sources of immigrants, each sending between 700,000 and 800,000 over this period.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="2855">The African immigrant population in the United States grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million in 2013, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/02/african-immigrant-population-in-u-s-steadily-climbs/">according to Pew</a>. The immigrant population from Middle Eastern countries grew from 235,000 in 1980 to 1.02 million in 2013, according to the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/middle-eastern-and-north-african-immigrants-united-states">census</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="3191">Opposition to the surge of non-European, nonwhite immigration is a bedrock of the Trump campaign, a crucial element of his attack on political correctness and a key component of the loyalty he elicits from noncollege, middle- and lower-income voters opposed to liberalized immigration — voters who believe they have been dispossessed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="3445">Trump’s successful deployment of the issue of immigration to mobilize voters raises this question: Why is his opposition to immigrants and Mexicans in particular so resonant when immigration liberalization ostensibly has <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/immigration.htm">majority support in most polls</a>?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="3652"><a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/janastas/publications/essays-politics-diversity-modern-america-causal-inference-approach">Research</a> conducted by Lefteris Jason Anastasopoulos, <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/lefterisanastasopoulos">a lecturer and data science fellow</a> at Berkeley’s School of Information, provides one answer: Support for immigration “may be greatly overestimated.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="3691">In an email, Anastasopoulos writes that</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="560" data-total-count="4251"><p>polls conducted by large survey organizations never ask about immigration in geographic context. Instead they ask questions about whether respondents support increasing immigration or granting amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the “United States” overall rather than, say, Dayton, Ohio, or Wilmington, North Carolina, places where immigration has been rapidly increasing over the past few years. This kind of abstract framing tends to push respondents toward giving more “politically correct” answers to standard poll questions about immigration.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="13" data-total-count="4264">The result is</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="4415"><p>a significant underestimation of the backlash against newly arriving immigrants and an overestimation of the support for immigration among the public.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="403" data-total-count="4818">The refusal of Democrats and the American left to hear — or to grant some legitimacy to — the grievances of white America as it loses power and stature to ascendant minorities and to waves of immigrants from across the globe undergirds the Trump movement. In the zero sum world of immigration politics, it has proved impossible so far to convincingly affirm the validity of the claims of both sides.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="5044">The quest by American liberals and progressives for support, or at least tolerance, of diversity, inclusiveness and multiculturalism is likely to prevail — particularly if the compulsory dimension of compliance is curtailed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="5260" id="story-continues-2">Jonathan Haidt, a professor at N.Y.U., suggested to me that one way to better understand the intensity of Trump’s appeal is by looking at something called “<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1967-08061-000">psychological reactance.</a>” Haidt describes reactance as</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="5607"><p>the feeling you get when people try to stop you from doing something you’ve been doing, and you perceive that they have no right or justification for stopping you. So you redouble your efforts and do it even more, just to show that you don’t accept their domination. Men in particular are concerned to show that they do not accept domination.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="5805">The theory, first developed in 1966 by Jack W. Brehm in “<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1967-08061-000">A Theory of Psychological Reactance</a>,” is directly relevant to the 2016 election, according to Haidt. Here is Brehm’s original language:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="433" data-total-count="6238"><p>Psychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response to regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and autonomy. This reaction is especially common when individuals feel obliged to adopt a particular opinion or engage in a specific behavior. Specifically, a perceived diminution in freedom ignites an emotional state, called psychological reactance, that elicits behaviors intended to restore this autonomy.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="6278">Haidt applies this to the 2016 election:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="6573"><p>Translated to the Trump phenomenon, I would say that decades of political correctness, with its focus on “straight white men” as the villains and oppressors — now extended to “straight white cis-gendered men” — has caused some degree of reactance in many and perhaps most white men.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="49" data-total-count="6622">In both the workplace and academia, Haidt argues,</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="6818"><p>the accusatory and vindictive approach of many social justice activists and diversity trainers may actually have increased the desire and willingness of some white men to say and do un-PC things.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="6857">In this atmosphere, according to Haidt,</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="7218"><p>Trump comes along and punches political correctness in the face. Anyone feeling some degree of anti-PC reactance is going to feel a thrill in their heart, and will want to stand up and applaud. And because feelings drive reasoning, these feelings of gratitude will make it hard for anyone to present arguments to them about the downsides of a Trump presidency.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="7441">Trump’s anger at being policed or fenced in apparently speaks to the resentment of many American men and their resistance to being instructed, particularly by a female candidate, on how they should think, speak or behave.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="7752">On April 26, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/26/trump_sweeps_hillary_only_has_the_womans_card_and_women_dont_like_her.html">Trump wheeled out a spectacularly offensive attack on Clinton</a>, perhaps designed to provoke the response it got. He accused her of playing “the women’s card” when “she has got nothing else going. Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get 5 percent of the vote.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="7864">Hillary rose to the bait. Three days later, appearing on Jake Tapper’s CNN show “The Lead,” she <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/29/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-off-the-reservation/">countered:</a></p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="8173"><p>I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak. … I am not going to deal with their temper tantrums, or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me. He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I could really care less.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="8444">Trump responded on <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/05/02/donald-trump-rips-hillarys-very-derogatory-statement-men-hannity-interview">Sean Hannity’s Fox News show</a> on May 2. What Clinton said “was a very derogatory statement to men,” Trump declared. “It was almost as though she’s going to tell us what to do, tell men what to do.” He continued, “It was a real put-down.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="8715">The kind of messages that provoke reactance and a defiant or oppositional response, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click">one study</a>, include “imperatives, such as ‘must’ or ‘need’; absolute allegations, such as ‘cannot deny that …’ and ‘any reasonable person would agree.’ ”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-3">Continue reading the main story</a>
