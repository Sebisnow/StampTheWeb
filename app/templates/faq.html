<h3 id="what-is">What is StampTheWeb?</h3>
StampTheWeb is a free Trusted timestamping service for web content. Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and
modification time of a document. This system creates timestamps of the requested web pages. To find more about Trusted timestamps visit its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping">Wikipedia Page.</a>
<br> <br>Use Cases<br>
<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Proving an information online existed at a certain point in time.
<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Comparing online information with a version from past.
<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Finding if changes occur in online news pages with time.
<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Proving an idea or information published online at a certain date and time.
<br><br>Trusted timestamps for offline digital documents can also be created using <a href="http://www.originstamp.org/">OriginStamp</a></p>

        <h3 id="credits" >Who created and inspires StampTheWeb</h3>
        <p>The idea for this project was provided by Prof. Bela Gipp from the Information Science Group at the
            University of Konstanz. The implementation started as a students project in Prof. Gipp's course Web Information Retrieval 2015/2016.
            The group of students, Manfred Sch&auml;fer, Tobias Bamberger and Sebastian Schneider layed the foundations (including the fabulous name <a href="/">StampTheWeb</a>) 
            and the first implementation for timestamping websites. <br>
            Furthermore StampTheWeb was adopted by Waqar Detho and Sebastian Schneider as part of a Master and Bachelor
            thesis at the University of Konstanz shaping the webservice to what it is now. The project was supervised by the doctoral student Corinna Breitinger.
            <br>
            The service of this site is based on the originstamp.org service and uses the <a href="http://www.originstamp.org/developer">OriginStamp API</a>, which were developed by André Gernandt,
            Thomas Hepp and Bela Gipp.</p>
        <h3 id="how-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>StampTheWeb extracts data from the requested web pages and calculates its hash and then creates timestamp for the hash which represents timestamp for the web content. Furthermore this timestamp and hash is aggregated to Bitcoin block chain network, by performing a Bitcoin transaction. This process makes it secure, since hash is always present in the distributed Bitcoin block chain network and could be verified from Bitcoin.
<br><img src="/pdf/Working.png"  style="width:768px;height:360px;"><br>
	<br>1) When a user submits a URL, 'StampTheWeb' extracts the URL from the internet and extracts the text from that URL and calculates hash from the text.
	<br>2) ‘StampTheWeb’ embeds this hash to the Bitcoin blockchain.
	<br>3) The hash is forever embedded in Bitcoin blockchain and can be verified by using blockchain.info or using blockchain itself or by using <a href="http://www.originstamp.org/">OriginStamp</a>
</p>

<h3 id="manipul">Why can’t the timestamp be manipulated?</h3>
<p>This timestamping services uses the cryptographic blockchain of the virtual currency bitcoin. The blockchain was designed to be tamper proof. If they could be manipulated than the whole currency would be worthless. In addition to the blockchain OriginStamp also publish the hash immediately on <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter</a></p>

<h3 id="services">What services StampTheWeb offers?</h3>

<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Time-stamp an article according to a user-defined schedule and compare it at regular intervals with the same page from other countries. The user is notified by email if changes are found.
</p>

<h3 id="timestamp">How can I timestamp a web article?</h3>
<p> Time-stamping a web article is very easy just provide the URL of the article you would like to timestamp and click 'submit'.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ruc7L6qL3Kk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3 id="compare-articles">How can I compare web articles?</h3>
<p>Please watch the video for answer:<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-l8-pcv20Ps" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3 id="schedule-work">How schedule recurring URLs work?</h3>
<p>‘StampTheWeb’ creates the timestamp of the provided URL and then frequently checks the article and compares it with the timestamped version. If ‘StampTheWeb’ finds a change in the version at the remote location then it will notify the user by email (if email is provide). In other way it will create another timestamp of the provided URL.</p>

<h3 id="schedule-country">How schedule recurring URLs from different locations work?</h3>
<p>‘StampTheWeb’ creates the timestamp of the provided URL and then frequently checks the article on the provided location (for example China) and compares it with the timestamped version. If ‘StampTheWeb’ finds a change in the version at the remote location then it will notify the user by email (if email is provide). In other way it will create another timestamp of the provided URL. Currently the following locations are supported review the following map for further details:
