<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="2466">If Mr. Sanders seemed on Wednesday to bow to political reality on the Democratic side — and to Mrs. Clinton’s apparent inevitability as the party’s nominee — Mr. Cruz took a far more defiant line in the Republican race.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="2780">Walloped by Mr. Trump in the last six primaries and lagging behind him in polls before next week’s contest in Indiana, Mr. Cruz made a daring but somewhat desperate announcement: that in the event of his nomination, Mrs. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, would be his vice-presidential running mate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="3075">Appearing alongside Mrs. Fiorina in Indianapolis, Mr. Cruz delivered a stemwinder of a speech, castigating Mr. Trump as an untrustworthy narcissist. He and Mrs. Fiorina jointly criticized the news media for rushing to treat Mr. Trump’s victory in the nomination fight as a foregone conclusion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="3191">The Republican race, Mrs. Fiorina said, was a struggle “for the soul of our party and the future of our nation.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="3445">By rushing out a vice-presidential pick before the Indiana vote, which is becoming make-or-break for his candidacy, Mr. Cruz opted to tear open his party’s divisions even more widely, rather than to stand down in view of Mr. Trump’s growing strength.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="3765" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Cruz’s criteria for a pick, in his telling, seemed to be aimed squarely at Mr. Trump. “Do they think through decisions in a rash and impulsive way?” he asked. “Do they pop off the handle at whatever strikes them at any given moment?” He held up Mrs. Fiorina as someone who knows “where jobs come from.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="4031">Mr. Cruz’s selection of Mrs. Fiorina may present a perilous challenge for Mr. Trump, who is grappling with mounting criticism of his derisive remarks about women, including his repeated claims that Mrs. Clinton’s sole political asset is “the woman’s card.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="4387">Mindful of the gender gap often evident in Mr. Trump’s polling, Cruz allies hope that Mrs. Fiorina will prove a capable foil to him, as she did while besting him in a series of debate exchanges during her own candidacy. Since endorsing Mr. Cruz last month, Mrs. Fiorina has proved to be an eager surrogate, attacking Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton with zeal.</p> <figure id="primary-calendar-and-results" class="interactive promo  layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="4705">Mr. Trump, viewed unfavorably by most women in general election polls, has clashed savagely with Mrs. Fiorina in the past. He has mocked her business record, her voice and even her looks. “Look at that face,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine last summer. “Would anyone vote for that?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="4904">Another slashing comment directed at Mrs. Fiorina’s appearance or gender could have grave consequences for Mr. Trump, especially with female voters he would need to win over to compete in the fall.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="5125">Mr. Trump responded to the surprise announcement with a degree of restraint. Referring to the “new relationship” between “Cruz and Carly,” Mr. Trump shook his head and raised his eyebrows as he dismissed the move.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="5358">“He has set a record,” Mr. Trump said of his opponent. “He is the first presidential candidate in the history of this country who’s mathematically eliminated from becoming president who chose a vice-presidential candidate.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="5518">Mr. Cruz’s gambit was received chiefly as an act of beleaguered improvisation — the political equivalent of a student pulling a fire alarm to avoid an exam.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="5817" id="story-continues-5">In the short term, Mr. Cruz may have succeeded in shifting the focus away from Mr. Trump’s success in the last two rounds of voting, and from his own wheezing alliance with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who agreed to clear out of Indiana if Mr. Cruz withdrew from competition in Oregon and New Mexico.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="6124">Yet his partnership with Mrs. Fiorina may prove of limited value if Mr. Trump clobbers them both in Indiana, where 57 delegates are at stake. Mr. Trump already leads Mr. Cruz by more than 400 delegates, and has gathered more than three-quarters of the delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="6338">Mr. Cruz acknowledged in his speech on Wednesday that he no longer had a chance of winning the 1,237 delegates required to become the nominee, but said he still planned to challenge Mr. Trump in an open convention.</p><figure id="1click-FD" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="6511">With his announcement, Mr. Cruz becomes the first candidate in 40 years — since Ronald Reagan in 1976 — to name a running mate before capturing his party’s nomination.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="6851">Far more conventional is Mr. Sanders’s shift toward a strategy of dogged and benign persistence, rather than aggressive confrontation with Mrs. Clinton. Candidates for president routinely scale back their campaigns but forge ahead because they hope to advance a specific policy agenda, or out of a sense of obligation to their supporters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="7063">Mrs. Clinton, for one, insisted on fighting the 2008 Democratic race all the way through the last day of primary voting, even after Barack Obama had gained a permanent upper hand in the competition for delegates.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="7432">Yet few losing candidates in recent memory have generated the kind of electric energy within the Democratic base that Mr. Sanders has in the 2016 election. Democratic leaders are especially sensitive to his following among young people, who have voted for him by staggering margins, and whose support Mrs. Clinton may rely on against Mr. Trump in the November election.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="7732">Even if Mr. Sanders shies away from direct conflict with Mrs. Clinton, he could still be an irksome presence in the race. He is likely to win several primaries in May, and a large-scale effort in California could pressure Mrs. Clinton to spend time and money there to forestall an embarrassing upset.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="7953" id="story-continues-6">But unlike Mr. Trump, who appears determined to batter Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich into submission, Mrs. Clinton and her allies have taken a gingerly approach to Mr. Sanders in what seem to be the waning days of his campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="8130">They have urged Mr. Sanders to sand down the sharpest edges of his arguments against Mrs. Clinton and begin to prepare the party for a moment of coming together in Philadelphia.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
</button>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="8354">Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Clinton supporter, said Democrats hoped for “a somewhat rapid conclusion” to the primaries, but viewed withdrawing from the presidential race as a “personal decision” for Mr. Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="8645">“Obviously, as you get to this point, you want to see all Democrats focused on the Republicans and not focused on each other,” Mr. Markell said. Mr. Sanders, he added, “certainly believes that electing one of these Republicans as president would be a real nightmare for the country.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
