<h1>sqlalchemy - How to elegantly check the existence of an object/instance/variable and simultaneously assign it to variable if it exists in python? - Stack Overflow</h1><html><body><div><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">&#13;
&#13;
<p>A question for the pythonistas beneath you. If this question makes no sense, please feel free to correct me. I for myself hope, that there is an answer to it, that will make my life easier. :-)</p>

<p>I am using SQLAlchemy to populate a database and often I need to check if a orm object exists in a database before processing. This may be an unconventional question, but I found myself encountering this pattern often:</p>

<pre><code>my_object = session.query(SomeObject).filter(some_fiter).first()
if my_object: # Mostly in databases...
    # Juchee it exists
    # process
else:
    # It does not exist. :-(
    my_object = SomeObject()
    # process
</code></pre>

<p>What I am <strong>dreaming</strong> of would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>if my_object = session.query(someObject).blabla.first():
    # if my_object is None this scope is left alone
    # if my_object is not None I can work with my_object here...
</code></pre>

<p>I know, that this syntax is wrong, but I wanted to explain, what I mean by this example. Any equivalent way would make me happy.</p>

<p>Is there an elegant python approach for this pattern? This question aims not only at SQLAlchemy, but to each equivalent scenario.</p>

<p><em>closing my eyes hitting "Post your question" and waiting for the smart people and pythonistas by heart to hunt me down for asking something mayhaps inappropriate</em> ;-)</p>
