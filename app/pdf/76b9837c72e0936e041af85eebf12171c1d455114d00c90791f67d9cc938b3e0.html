<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="2159">The Gotthard has been a symbol of Swiss unity going back to the 13th century, and it was later the centerpiece of Switzerland’s plan of defense in case of an invasion by Nazi Germany, although that never happened. It was also the site of a 19th-century engineering feat in the Alps, a rail tunnel that opened in 1882 to great fanfare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="2410">In 1879, The New York Times lauded that project as “adding another to the many records of man’s industry and ingenuity in subduing the mightiest obstacles which nature has interposed in the way of free communication between country and country.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="2603">Another Times headline in 1880 reported “<a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/03/01/98613738.html?pageNumber=1">Mount St. Gothard Successfully Pierced</a>,” and two years later, the newspaper heralded the “<a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/06/09/102779870.html?pageNumber=2">formal opening of the newest and best way into Italy</a>.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="2779">In 1947, the Swiss engineer Carl Eduard Gruner proposed a Gotthard base tunnel, between Amsteg and Bodio, but the route had to be altered several times for engineering reasons.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="3013" id="story-continues-2">The final breakthrough, on a section between Sedrun and Faido, came in 2010. It took 125 workers in three shifts round-the-clock to install the concrete slab track on which the trains will run, with some sections as deep as 1.4 miles.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="3229">On Wednesday, religious leaders blessed the tunnel; a statue of St. Barbara, the patron saint of miners, stands inside it. Nine workers who died while building the tunnel <a href="https://www.alptransit.ch/en/media/press-releases/detail/article/memorial-ceremony-for-deceased-tunnel-workers/">were </a><a href="https://www.alptransit.ch/en/media/press-releases/detail/article/memorial-ceremony-for-deceased-tunnel-workers/">honored</a> on Tuesday with a bronze plaque.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="3339">Five hundred passengers, selected from a lottery that 130,000 people entered, took part in the inaugural ride.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="3625">Among the leaders in attendance were the Swiss president, Johann Schneider-Ammann, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President François Hollande of France, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, Prime Minister Adrian Hasler of Liechtenstein, and Chancellor Christian Kern of Austria.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="3931">After testing ends this year, around 260 freight trains and 65 passenger trains are expected to travel through the two-tube tunnel each day, reaching speeds approaching 100 miles an hour for freight and 125 miles an hour with passengers. Passenger trains are expected to eventually reach 155 miles an hour.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="4025">Goods currently carried by a million trucks a year will eventually be moved by trains instead.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
