<p itemprop="articleBody">
Presumptive <a id="ramplink_GOP presidential_" target="_blank">GOP presidential</a> nominee <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/donald-trump.htm" id="ramplink_Donald Trump_" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> and House Speaker Paul Ryan described their meetings in Washington, D.C., today as a "positive step" toward unifying the Republican Party, even as Ryan again declined to endorse the New York billionaire.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The two men issued a joint statement calling for Republicans to "unite around our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda and do all we can to win this fall."
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"With that focus, we had a great conversation this morning. While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,” Trump and Ryan said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
“We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there’s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification.”
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Trump tweeted after the meeting, saying things were "working out very well."

But the face-to-face meeting did not result in an endorsement from Ryan, the nation's top elected Republican official. Ryan, who said he was "encouraged" by their discussions, refrained from offering an endorsement of Trump when asked by ABC News' Jonathan Karl.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"It’s very important that we don’t fake unifying, we don’t pretend unification, that we truly and actually unify so we are full strength in the fall," Ryan said at a news conference after the meeting. "I don’t want us to have a fake unification process here."
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Trump started his day on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/capitol-hill.htm" id="ramplink_Capitol Hill_" target="_blank">Capitol Hill</a> at the headquarters of the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/republican-national-committee.htm" id="ramplink_Republican National Committee_" target="_blank">Republican National Committee</a>, where he met with Speaker Ryan and RNC Chairman <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/reince-priebus.htm" id="ramplink_Reince Priebus_" target="_blank">Reince Priebus</a>.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Priebus tweeted about the first meeting after its conclusion, calling the visit a "positive step" in uniting the party.
