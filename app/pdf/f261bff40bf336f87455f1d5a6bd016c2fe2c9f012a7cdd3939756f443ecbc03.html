The test transmission of the station occurred on May 25, 2007, and the channel went live on July 23, 2007. Originally in English, on May 15, 2010, Dawn News converted into an Urdu news channel after successful test transmission of four hours a day. The conversion was mainly due to its financial crisis and thin viewership in the country. <a href="/wiki/Express_24/7" title="Express 24/7">Express 24/7</a> replaced it as Pakistan's only English news channel briefly, until it too was shut down by Express Media Group for financial reasons.</p>
<p>Dawn News' test transmission was launched by former <a href="/wiki/President_of_Pakistan" title="President of Pakistan">President of Pakistan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a>. The complete launch of the channel coincided with the result of the Supreme Court case which cleared the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Pakistan" title="Chief Justice of Pakistan">Chief Justice</a> <a href="/wiki/Iftikhar_Muhammad_Chaudhry" title="Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry">Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry</a>, who had been suspended by General Musharraf.

<p>The founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah" title="Muhammad Ali Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a> launched the Dawn newspaper in the 1940s- it is the oldest English language newspaper in Pakistan.</p>
<p>DawnNews was launched as Pakistan's first English news and current affairs channel and vows to "provide its viewers with a medium that is responsible, credible and balanced. The channel has bureaux in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Quetta and Peshawar, with studio facilities in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including digital satellite news gathering (DSNG) capability and broadband global area networks (BGANs), the channel has the capacity to provide live transmission from remote areas via satellite, thus enabling comprehensive and prompt news coverage from across the country.</p>
<p>After a brief test transmission, the channel went live on July 23, 2007. Over the past few years the channel has established its fame being the most credible voice in the murky pool of electronic media, in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Keeping in view the public demand, DawnNews had decided to launch a separate Urdu news channel. But before launching the separate channel, it had started a three-hour Urdu transmission within its English channel’s airtime, which was later increased to 12 hours. The channel officially put an end to its English language programming on May 15, 2010.</p>
<p>DawnNews has broken a number of big stories. It was DawnNews which exclusively broadcast the footage of the assassin of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. It was DawnNews that got official confirmation from Pakistan that lone surviving gunman of Mumbai terror attacks – Ajmal Kasab – was a Pakistani.</p>
<p>Besides, DawnNews has covered major events including Lal Masjid operation, lawyers’ movement, military operations in tribal areas and 2008 general elections. Most of the time, the channel beat its rivals despite limited resources.</p>
<p>DawnNews transmission is watched in all urban areas of Pakistan. It also has access to the rural population, wherever the cable reaches. DawnNews is in agreement with several satellite TV channels, which include BBC World, Sky News, ABC News and Al-Jazeera and can be watched in the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa. In U.K. it can be accessed through Sky cable at Channel 845.</p>
