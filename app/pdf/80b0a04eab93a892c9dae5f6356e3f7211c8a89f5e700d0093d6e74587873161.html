<h1>The Republicans’ Big Hot Mess - The New York Times</h1><html><body><div><div class="story-body story-body-2">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="2544" id="story-continues-3">Will Tightwad Trump foot the bill himself? That’s hard to envision, given how many vendors he’s stiffed over time. And how loath he is <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-no-taxes-224498">to paying taxes</a>. And how grudgingly he’s been known to follow through on a charitable donation. And how exultant he’s been about not pumping huge sums into his campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="172" data-total-count="2716">The pall over Cleveland reflects an animosity between him and other Republicans that’s only getting worse. There’s no way to overstate how extraordinary all of this is.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="2972">Over the last two weeks, the Trump campaign’s feuding with the Republican National Committee intensified. The number of Republican senators and governors who have said they are not yet ready to endorse him — or won’t ever do so — continued to grow.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="334" data-total-count="3306">Over the last several days, Politico published <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-vice-president-224488">a story noting</a> that Trump’s vice-presidential finalists may come down to the puny band of miscreants who can bear to say yes. And Sam Clovis, a co-chairman of the Trump campaign, grumbled that all those Republicans who can’t get fully behind Trump should “just shut the hell up.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="122" data-total-count="3428">Perhaps Clovis was miffed because Paul Ryan, who <em>has </em>gotten behind Trump, felt compelled to publicly rebuke him yet again.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="3611">This is the cringe-inducing “Groundhog Day” of Ryan’s script: You’re a racist, Donald! But you’re my racist. Bad Donald for that Muslim ban! But you’re good enough for me.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="3754" id="story-continues-4">Ryan’s fans in the party are dying. His political future may be, too. He’s not so much behind Trump as under him, and he’s being crushed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="4147">His counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, also supports Trump and also looks as if he’s about to throw up whenever the billionaire’s name is mentioned. He tries to sidestep the topic, a practice so prevalent on Capitol Hill that my Times colleague Jennifer Steinhauer last week produced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/us/politics/on-donald-trump-republicans-keep-distance-in-different-ways.html">a taxonomy of Trump avoiders</a>, under the headline: “The 5 Types of Trump-Averse Republicans.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="4451">I’m told that McConnell is freaking out about the newest voter surveys, like <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-14/bloomberg-politics-national-poll-june-2016">one by Bloomberg Politics</a> that showed Hillary Clinton with a 12-point lead <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/06/15/National-Politics/Polling/release_427.xml?tid=a_inl">and another</a> by ABC News and The Washington Post that put Trump’s unfavorable rating at 70 percent. McConnell sees his Senate majority slipping away.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="4764">“Trump’s stomach-churning behavior would be manageable if his poll numbers were holding up,” said one disgusted Republican strategist who doesn’t support Trump and was mocking the thinking of Republicans who do. “But there’s a perfect correlation between tolerance for misbehavior and poll numbers.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="5102">SEVERAL party insiders told me that if Trump continued to behave as outrageously as he did when attacking the judge in the Trump University case and implying that President Obama sympathized with terrorists, there could yet be stratagems to deny him the nomination in Cleveland. Trump-opposed delegates have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dozens-of-gop-delegates-launch-new-push-to-halt-donald-trump/2016/06/17/e8dcf74e-3491-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html">organizing and agitating</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="118" data-total-count="5220">“People are stirring,” one strategist told me. And another: “It feels like the wheels are coming off the bus.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="5353">I’m skeptical. The wheels are always coming off the Trump bus, but he has multiple planes and a helicopter to boot. He stays aloft.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="5675">What I’m sure of is a convention like none before it. Many of the sorts of congressional staffers who are typically eager to pitch in will travel to Cleveland only at the insistence of their bosses and under duress. “It is going to resemble a funeral for a relative everyone hates,” one Capitol Hill veteran told me.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="5891" id="story-continues-5">At the last few G.O.P. conventions, the effort to put minority candidates and office holders onstage was so vigorous that it became a running joke, but how many blacks and Hispanics will be willing to buttress Trump?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="6011">He said that he’d like to have the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady give remarks. About Deflategate? Gisele?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="6344">What <em>will </em>the talking points be? Even many Republicans who have dutifully fallen in line take issue with much of what Trump pronounces and proposes. So I suppose they stand sheepishly at the microphone and rant without interruption about the evils of the Clintons. Do politics-soured swing voters really crave hour upon hour of that?</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="6648">I’m overlooking some eager Trump cheerleaders. My bad. Newt Gingrich is on board, and boy can he talk … and talk … and talk. Chris Christie is at the ready, with a hunger for attention that’s not quickly sated. So maybe we get several scoops of each of them, with an omnipresent topping of Trump.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="63" data-total-count="6711">What a sundae. Could put me off dairy into the next millennium.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
