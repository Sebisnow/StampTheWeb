<h1>For Some Living With Flint Water Crisis, Obama Visit Is Overdue - The New York Times</h1><html><body><div><div class="story-body">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="1692" id="story-continues-3">Mr. Obama has been under pressure for months to visit Flint. White House aides said he had decided to make the trip after receiving a letter from an 8-year-old girl.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="1921">“I am one of the children that is affected by this water, and I’ve been doing my best to march in protest and to speak out for all the kids that live here in Flint,” the girl, Amariyanna Copeny, wrote to Mr. Obama in March.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="2083">Mr. Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/04/27/asked-and-answered-president-obama-responds-eight-year-old-girl-flint" title="White House blog post.">wrote back</a> late last month. “I want to make sure that people like you and your family are receiving the help you need and deserve,” his letter said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="2406">White House officials said Mr. Obama would point out to residents that the federal government has provided 7.3 million liters of water and 55,000 water filters. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said this week that federal agencies were providing a “significant expansion” in health care services to Flint.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="2668">Members of the president’s cabinet, including Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the E.P.A., have already visited. Cecilia Muñoz, the president’s top domestic policy adviser, was in Flint on Tuesday to discuss the crisis with residents and local officials.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="252" data-total-count="2920">But critics said the federal government had been conspicuously absent during the crucial months before the crisis was declared, when residents were drinking the lead-tainted water, and state and local officials were largely <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/flint-michigan-lead-water-crisis.html" title="Times article.">brushing off their concerns</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="487" data-total-count="3407" id="story-continues-4">Emails from last summer, which were among thousands of pages of messages and documents released this year, show a lack of alarm about the water crisis on the part of some officials at the E.P.A. Susan Hedman, a regional administrator for the agency, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/flint-fallout-a-resignation-a-hearing-and-us-aid.html" title="Times article.">resigned</a> in January, and Ms. McCarthy withstood <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/us/michigan-governor-tells-congress-he-was-misled-on-flint-water.html" title="Times article.">withering attacks</a> by Republicans during a House Oversight Committee hearing about the agency’s failure to step in. She had argued that states have primary responsibility for <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/safety/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Safety." class="meta-classifier">water safety</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="3641">In a June 2015 report, Miguel Del Toral, a scientist for the E.P.A., pointed out gaping problems with Flint’s methods of testing lead in water, sky-high levels of lead in one Flint home, and a lack of corrosion control in the water.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="3892">Two weeks after he wrote the report, Mr. Del Toral complained in an email on July 8 that he was being marginalized for sounding that alarm. “It almost sounds like I’m to be stuck in a corner holding up a potted plant because of Flint,” he wrote.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="4114">Other emails released last week show that the agency’s regional office in Chicago was receiving complaints from Flint residents in 2014, months after the city switched from Lake Huron water to water from the Flint River.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="4466">Savannah Young, a Flint resident, sent an email to the E.P.A. in September 2014 that described her water in blunt terms. “My Flint City tap water is brown,” she wrote. “It cannot possibly be safe to drink. No person is available to discuss this issue with me, even after already having three boil water advisories in less than two months time.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="425" data-total-count="4891">Mr. Earnest said that as president, Mr. Obama “takes responsibility for lots of things.” But he dismissed the idea that the president would offer an apology to Flint’s residents when he meets with several of them on Wednesday. Mr. Earnest cited <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/us/flint-water-crisis.html" title="Times article.">the findings of a commission</a> set up by Michigan’s Republican governor, which placed “primary responsibility” for the water crisis on the state-run environmental agency.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="301" data-total-count="5192">Instead, Mr. Obama is likely to use his visit to Flint as an opportunity to pressure Republicans in Congress to support billions of dollars in improvements to infrastructure around the country. Aides said he would insist that crises like the one in Flint could be prevented with the right investments.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="5360">The president may also tweak Republicans in Congress, and some of the party’s presidential candidates, who have suggested deep cuts to federal environmental programs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="5586" id="story-continues-5">While in Flint, Mr. Obama is scheduled to receive a briefing from state and local officials, including Gov. Rick Snyder, who has borne the brunt of the blame for the crisis. Mr. Snyder <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/michigan-governor-backtracks-seeks-to-meet-obama-in-flint.html" title="Times article.">requested the meeting</a>, he said on Monday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="5722">Mr. Obama will also sit down privately with a small group of Flint residents and then deliver remarks before heading back to Washington.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="5907">At Northwestern High School on the northern edge of Flint on Tuesday, a worker carefully added bright green letters to the school’s marquee to spell out “Welcome <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Barack Obama" class="meta-per">President Obama</a>.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="6100">Jim Ananich, a Democratic state senator whose district includes Flint, said in an email that he hoped Mr. Obama’s visit would lead to a renewed sense of urgency around Flint’s water issues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="417" data-total-count="6517">“The E.P.A. should have taken over as soon as it was apparent that Governor Snyder’s emergency managers and D.E.Q. were completely incapable of protecting the public health,” he said, using an abbreviation for the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. “But my neighbors and I understand that the administration is stepping up to do what it can, even while the state response continues to flounder.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="6808">Some Flint residents said they were exhausted and hopeful that they would soon be able to return to a normal way of life. Many people are still making twice-weekly treks to fire stations to pick up cases of bottled water, which they use for drinking, washing dishes and brushing their teeth.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="6984">Jackie Anderson, a probation officer who lives in Flint, said that she wished Mr. Obama had visited months ago, but that she believed his trip would raise the city’s spirits.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="7168">“I think on a wide level, it’ll be good for the city to see that he’s supportive of us,” she said. “I want to hear what he’s going to do that will make a big difference.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
