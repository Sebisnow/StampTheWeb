        </figure><p class="story-body__introduction">German carmaker Volkswagen has reportedly reached a $15bn (£11.3bn) settlement with US car owners after admitting it cheated emission tests.</p><p>The deal would offer to repair or buy back the affected diesel vehicles and pay owners compensation, according to sources close to the talks.</p><p>Last year, US regulators discovered that VW cars were fitted with software that could distort emissions tests.</p><p>The German giant subsequently said 11 million cars were affected worldwide.</p><p>The US settlement is still pending approval by a judge, but it would be the largest car scandal settlement in the country's history. The details are expected to be announced on Tuesday. </p><p>According to news agencies, the legal settlement sets aside $10bn to repair or buy back around 475,000 affected vehicles with 2-litre diesel engines, and to compensate owners with a payment of up to $10,000. </p><p>Car owners would still be able to decline the VW offer and sue the firm on their own.</p><p>According to the sources quoted by news agencies, the deal also includes $2.7bn in funds to offset excess diesel emissions and $2bn for research into green energy and environment-friendly cars. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Caught cheating</h2>                                                                                                    <p>The German carmaker installed software in diesel engines to detect when they were being tested so the cars could cheat the results. </p><p>Some models could have been pumping out up to 40 times the legal limit of the pollutant, nitrogen oxide, regulators disclosed.</p><p>Volkswagen told its shareholders last year it had set aside $7.3bn to help defray the potential costs of a recall or regulatory penalties. </p><p>That amount though might not be enough - the company faces as much as $20bn in fines for Clean Air Act violations alone.</p><p>The increased emissions provision pushed VW to an annual pre-tax loss of €1.3bn (€1.4bn), compared with a profit of €14.7bn the previous year.</p><p>VW expected group sales to fall by up to 5% in 2016.</p>
