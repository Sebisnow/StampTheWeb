<h1>‘Always Agitated. Always Mad’: Omar Mateen, According to Those Who Knew Him - The New York Times</h1><html><body><div><div class="story-body story-body-2">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="5671" id="story-continues-4">“He got on, walked up the first couple of steps, held his arms out and made sounds like a motor and then made an explosion sound — and slipped into his seat,” Robert Zirkle, another student on the bus, remembered. “He did this three or four times, and was clearly not in the mood or the same state of mind that we were in. He seemed excited.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="5764">His unsettling pantomimes ended when others told him there would be problems if he continued.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="6125">Omar cycled through three high schools, collecting a string of suspensions — for fighting and other infractions — along the way. (In one case, a charge of battery was adjudicated and a charge of disturbing school function was dropped, he later wrote to a potential employer. “This was an experience of me growing up and I learned a big lesson from it.”)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="6350">Martin Bielicki, a former dean of students at Martin County High School, remembered in an email that this student “had issues with other students, in particular,” and “always would argue back and even defend himself.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="6524" id="story-continues-5">“I remember Omar as a 14-year-old boy,” Mr. Bielicki wrote. “I look at that yearbook picture of him and it brings back memories of an innocent and likable young man.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="6685">Omar matured with time. He took up soccer and skateboarding, became infatuated with weight lifting, and shed the flabbiness that had become a source of ridicule.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="6860">He became so muscular that a friend, Sean Chagani, once asked him whether he was taking steroids. Recalled Mr. Chagani: “He kind of smirked and asked, ‘Can you tell?’”</p><figure id="media-100000004479667" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004479667 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/19/us/19MATEEN7/19MATEEN7-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="7057">The Mateen boy was more awkward than most teenagers, he recalled, but the two managed to find common ground. They played basketball, competed in video games and swam in the Chagani family’s pool.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="7236">“I had plenty of friends growing up that I would consider kind of odd, and he was one of them,” Mr. Chagani said. “But certainly not aggressive, violent, homophobic, etc.”</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="12" data-total-count="7248">Career Goals</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="7498">Omar secured after-school jobs here and there, including at a Publix grocery store, and improved so strikingly in the classroom that he graduated from Stuart Adult Community High School in April 2003 in the top half of his class — at the age of 16.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="7853">He moved from one low-level job to the next: a cashier and cook at a Chick-fil-A, a cashier at a Walgreens, a cashier at a Nutrition World, a floor watcher at a Gold’s Gym, a sales clerk at a GNC vitamin and supplement store. All the while, though, he was attending a community college, working toward an associate degree in criminal justice technology.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="98" data-total-count="7951">His passion, it seems, was in law enforcement: Omar Mateen saw himself in uniform, buff and armed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="8256">In May 2005, the 18-year-old requested to go on a ride-along with a St. Lucie County deputy sheriff. But the ride that took place after he passed a background check now seems enveloped in an air of foreboding. The deputy sheriff’s car crashed, and the teenager was taken to a hospital to be checked out.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="8584" id="story-continues-6">After earning his degree, Mr. Mateen applied for an officer’s job with the Florida Department of Corrections, bolstering his application with an impressive letter of recommendation from Officer Steven J. Brown of the Port St. Lucie Police. “I would sleep soundly at night knowing that a person like Omar is protecting us.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="423" data-total-count="9007">The young man’s dream was conditionally realized when he was sworn in as a Corrections Department employee and assigned as a trainee to the Martin Correctional Institution in Indiantown, not far from where he grew up. Four months in, he seemed on his way to a career in law enforcement, having received an evaluation of meeting expectations — of having the makings of one day becoming a “good correctional officer.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="9150">But six months in, Mr. Mateen was fired. The unsettling reasons were revealed in documents released by the Department of Corrections on Friday.</p><figure class="promo media video embedded layout-large-horizontal " data-videoid="100000004472139" data-media-action="modal" data-autoplay="false" data-embedded="false" data-adsensitivity="noads" data-live="false" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="9472">An officer reported in a memorandum that during training Mr. Mateen had laughingly asked him “if he was to bring a gun to school would I tell anybody.” He posed his question on April 14, 2007, two days before a student named Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others on the campus of Virginia Tech.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="9671">Mr. Mateen’s joke, if that is what it was, coupled with his penchant for sleeping in class and being absent without permission, prompted the warden, Powell H. Skipper, to recommend his termination.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="9851">“In light of recent tragic events at Virginia Tech, Officer Mateen’s inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing,” Mr. Skipper wrote at the time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="526" data-total-count="10377">Denied the right to wear one uniform, Mr. Mateen soon dressed in another — that of a security guard. He completed a training course, passed a background check, and began working for a security firm called G4S. At one point, perhaps as part of a G4S contract, he was working as an intake officer at a Florida juvenile assessment center. At another point, he was providing security after the BP <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/gulf_of_mexico_2010/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about oil spills." class="meta-classifier">oil spill</a> in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, during which an undercover documentarian recorded a few of his cynical observations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="10731">“No one gives a shit here, like everyone is just out to get paid,” he is recorded as saying. “They’re like hoping for more oil to come out and more people to complain so they’ll have the jobs. Because once people get laid off here, it’s going to suck for them. They want more disaster to happen because that’s where their moneymaking is.”</p>
<h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="10753">Hints of a Darker Side</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="431" data-total-count="11184" id="story-continues-7">Life continued. He had connected online with a young woman named Sitora Yusufiy, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, who initially found him to be a nice, funny man who treated his family well and had aspirations of becoming a police officer. He was religious — he made at least two Islamic pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia — but he never expressed sympathy for radical Islamists or terrorists, she said. And, yes, he could be homophobic.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="11374">Soon after their marriage in April 2009, Ms. Yusufiy said, he began beating her and isolating her in their Florida home. With the help of her parents in New Jersey, she fled within the year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="11544">The next year, he was married again, to a woman he met online, this time to Noor Salman, in Rodeo, Calif., though he cultivated the persona of a man with a wandering eye.</p><figure id="201606-orlando-victims-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="11838">Mr. Mateen used a dating website to seek a relationship with a woman in Fort Pierce. He churned through usernames — “makeitlovelylol” among them — and lied about his age, according to the woman, who requested anonymity but who provided photos that she had saved from his dating profile.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="12035">At one point, she said, Mr. Mateen’s pursuit veered toward stalking. He began messaging her to say he was nearby. He knew the color of her car and the general location of her place of employment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="512" data-total-count="12547">Other hints of a disturbed mind continued to emerge. In 2013, G4S removed Mr. Mateen from his security post at the St. Lucie County Courthouse after he had made “inflammatory comments” about being involved somehow in terrorism. Though far-fetched and even contradictory — he claimed connections to Al Qaeda, the Sunni extremist group, and ties to its near opposite, the Shiite Hezbollah — his comments were troubling enough for the county sheriff’s office to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="51" data-total-count="12598">The bureau’s subsequent inquiry was inconclusive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="12895">The next year, Mr. Mateen again attracted federal scrutiny, after an acquaintance from his mosque, the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, carried out a suicide bombing in Syria. According to F.B.I. Director James B. Comey, federal investigators concluded that Mr. Mateen knew the bomber only casually.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="13180">The mosque’s imam, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/orlando-nightclub-shooting-live-updates/imam-we-dont-talk/">Syed Shafeeq Rahman</a>, insisted that Mr. Mateen had never heard teachings at the mosque that would have radicalized him. “There is nothing that he is hearing from me to do killing, to do bloodshed, to do anything, because we never talk like that,” the imam said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="13540" id="story-continues-8">By the end of 2014, Mr. Mateen — the bodybuilder who had once imagined a respected future in law enforcement — was working the guard’s booth at the entrance to PGA Village, a golf resort community in Port St. Lucie. But even in this low-pressure position, he managed to unnerve and upset, especially when he seemed to think that he had been disrespected.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="13566">‘Straight-Up Predator’</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="13893">Heath Holtzclaw, who worked security at PGA Village a few years ago, has not forgotten how enraged Mr. Mateen became when he thought someone had given him an attitude. “You could tell he wanted to say something to whoever he felt had slighted him, but he never did,” Mr. Holtzclaw said. “He just slammed things around.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="14047">Mr. Mateen would make people wait at the gate, sometimes causing delays, if he felt he had been disrespected, or if it was time for him to do his prayers.</p><figure id="media-100000004479666" class="media photo embedded layout-small-vertical media-100000004479666" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/19/us/19MATEEN6/19MATEEN6-master180.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="14208">Jasmine Kalenuik, a frequent visitor to PGA Village, came to dread encountering the guard at the gate — who, she said, “acted like a straight-up predator.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="14492">“When I would go to grab my ID from his hand, he would cling to it and try to pull it back,” Ms. Kalenuik, 31, recalled. “He would hover over my car window and lean way in while breathing heavy on me with his teeth so clenched that you could see his jaw muscles sticking out.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="14648">Ms. Kalenuik’s husband, Jerry, recently confronted the security guard, nearly nose to nose. But Mr. Mateen betrayed no emotion during the angry encounter.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="14784">“It was like I was staring into the eyes of Ted Bundy,” Mr. Kalenuik, 27, said. “I was irate but he seemed completely detached.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="14928">After that, he said, Mr. Mateen would grant him and his wife a curt nod as they passed through the checkpoint, but never looked them in the eye.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="15081" id="story-continues-9">Finally, it seems, rage consumed the man. Over what — infidels, gays, society’s failure to grant him proper deference, all of it — remains unclear.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="349" data-total-count="15430">His father has suggested that Mr. Mateen was incensed by the sight of two men kissing in front of his young son, whose bedroom was chock-full with all things Disney, all things America: a Spider-Man helmet and bicycle, a Star Wars backpack, Star Wars drapes, a chair in the likeness of Tow Mater from “Cars,” and not one but three Mickey Mouses.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
</button>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="15587">Earlier this month, legally and with little wait, the man rejected by law enforcement purchased a Glock 9mm handgun and a SIG Sauer MCX military-style rifle.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="15833">Then, early last Sunday morning, he carried his recent purchases into the Pulse nightclub, where hundreds of people were drinking and dancing and celebrating life, the way families do at weddings. And, following his own rhythm, he began to shoot.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
