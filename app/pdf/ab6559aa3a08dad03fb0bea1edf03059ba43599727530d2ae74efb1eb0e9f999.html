        </figure><p class="story-body__introduction">European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has urged UK to "clarify its position" on Brexit as soon as possible.</p><p>He told the European parliament that Britain and the UK remained friends but it needed to state its position to avoid uncertainty.</p><p>PM David Cameron is to meet European Union leaders for the first time since the UK voted to leave later on Tuesday.</p><p>He is stepping down to allow his successor to conduct exit negotiations.</p><p>Mr Cameron has said it will be up to the next prime minister when to trigger the formal method by which a country leaves the EU, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.</p><p>"We need to clarify the situation as quickly as possible. But I'm still sad because I'm not a robot, a grey bureaucrat or technocrat," Mr Juncker said.</p><p>"I'm a European and I have a right to say I regret the result of the British vote."</p><p>Mr Juncker also echoed comments from the leaders of France, Germany and Italy that there can be no informal talks until Britain began the exit process.</p>                                                                                                    <p>"We cannot allow a long period of uncertainty. There can be no secret negotiations. No notification, no negotiation," he said.</p><p>He also said the will of the British people must be respected, prompting applause from UK Independence Party (Ukip) leader Nigel Farage, a key campaigner behind the leave vote.</p><p>"You were fighting for the exit, the British people voted in favour of the exit. Why are you here?" Mr Junker said to him.</p><p>Manfred Weber, the chairman of the European People's Party grouping in the European parliament delivered an angry rebuke to Mr Farage.</p><p>Mr Weber said the "worst liars can be found amongst Ukip". He said Mr Farage had gone back on a pledge to fund the NHS with money taken back from EU contributions.</p><p>"Apologise to the British, shame on you," he told Mr Farage, adding: "Stop this populist Brussels bashing."</p><p>Mr Weber also said: "The times of appeasement are over. We have to stand up for our European project."</p>
