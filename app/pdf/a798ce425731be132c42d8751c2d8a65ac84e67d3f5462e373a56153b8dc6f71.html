<h1>Brexit, Corbyn loses confidence vote and Cameron in Brussels - BBC News</h1><html><body><div><div class="lx-stream-post-body" data-reactid=".17fh8468b28.1.0.0.1.0.0.0.2.0.0.$k57729efee4b01a505b8277ed.3.0.0"><p>In response to the no confidence vote, Jeremy Corbyn has issued the following statement:</p><p>"In the aftermath of last week’s referendum, our country faces major challenges. Risks to the economy and living standards are growing. The public is divided.</p><p>"The government is in disarray. Ministers have made it clear they have no exit plan, but are determined to make working people pay with a new round of cuts and tax rises.</p><p>"Labour has the responsibility to give a lead where the government will not. We need to bring people together, hold the government to account, oppose austerity and set out a path to exit that will protect jobs and incomes.</p><p>“To do that we need to stand together. Since I was elected leader of our party nine months ago, we have repeatedly defeated the government over its attacks on living standards.</p><p>“Last month, Labour become the largest party in the local elections. In Thursday’s referendum, a narrow majority voted to Leave, but two thirds of Labour supporters backed our call for a Remain vote.</p><blockquote class="lx-stream-post-quote lx-stream-post-quote--default"><div class="lx-stream-post-quote__body"><p>I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60% of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning. Today’s vote by MPs has no constitutional legitimacy. We are a democratic party, with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour party members, trade unionists and MPs to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country.”</p></div><footer class="lx-stream-post-quote__cite gel-brevier gel-brevier-bold"><cite class="lx-stream-post-quote__cite-name"/></footer></blockquote></div></div></body></html></body>
